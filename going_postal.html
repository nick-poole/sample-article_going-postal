    <h1>Parcel Bombers</h1>
        <p>In the past few hours, US Secret Service and 
           law enforcement intercepted a series of explosive
           devices intended for delivery to a number of high 
           profile political targets. On Monday, an explosive 
           <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/clinton-bomb-reports-delivery-home-new-york-hillary-bill-latest">device was found in the mailbox of George Soros's 
            home in Katonah, NY.</a>
           
           Since then, packages potentially containing explosives
           have been addressed or delivered to former Secretary of 
           State Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, 
           former Attorney General Eric Holder, Rep. Maxine Waters, 
           and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Another device, 
           addressed to Former CIA Director John Brennan, 
           was sent to CNN in New York.
