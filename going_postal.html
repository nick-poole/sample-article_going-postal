                <h1>Domestic Terrorists are weaponizing the mail once again. Here is a Brief Look at Parcel Bombers From the Past.</h1>
                    
                    <p>In the past few hours, US Secret Service and law enforcement intercepted a series of explosive devices intended for delivery to a number of high 
                        profile political targets. On Monday, an explosive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/24/clinton-bomb-reports-delivery-home-new-york-hillary-bill-latest">device was found in the mailbox of George Soros's 
                        home in Katonah, NY.</a> Since then, packages potentially containing explosives have been addressed or delivered to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Rep. Maxine Waters,
                        and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Another device, addressed to Former CIA Director John Brennan, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/clintons-obama-suspicious-packages/index.html">was sent to CNN in New York.</a> </p>

                    <p>Reflecting back to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/24/when-anthrax-laced-letters-terrorized-washington-new-york/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.394ab5ac5394">Anthrax attacks of the early 2000's</a>,
                       it is not uncommon to see this form of terrorism manifest during times of politcal divisiveness. This may be the first time multiple high profile individuals were targeted in a parcel bomb plot, 
                       but we have seen the mail system weaponized on many occasions in the past.</p>

                <h2>Thanh Cong Phan</h2>
                 <!--href for TCP-->

                    <p>On March 26th, 2018, a number of parcels with mock explosives were <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/28/explosive-packages-washington-d-c-thanh-cong-phan/466388002/">mailed to several government and military sites</a>
                       in the Washington D.C. metro Area. The parcels were sent by 43-year-old Seattle resident, Thanh Cong Phan who had been in frequent contact with the FBI for letters he mailed to other government agencies in the past. 
                       The parcels tested positive for black powder, a substance found in explosive devices, and an X-ray scan appeared to show a GPS locator and fuse attachment. This incident was quickly overshadowed by a series of bombings in the Austin Metropolitan Area earlier the same month.</p>
                
                <h2>Austin Serial Bombings</h2>

                    <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/austin-bomber-dead-suspect-kills-himself-early-today-round-rock-tx-2018-03-21-live-updates/">The Austin bombings</a> were clustered around the greater metropolitan area with the exception of one 
                       which took place at a FedEx distribution center in Schertz, Texas.</p>

                       <ul>
                           <li><em>On March 2nd, - An African American male was killed when a package which had been left on his doorstep exploded in Harris Ridge</em></li>

                           <li><em>On March 12th, - An IED, believed to have been hand delivered by the perpetrator killed an African American teenager and injured a woman at their home in Old Fort Hill Drive, Austin. </em></li>

                           <li><em>Also on March 12th, 2018 â€“ a package exploded injuring an elderly Hispanic woman at her home.</em></li>
                       </ul>

                    <p>In all three of these initial attacks, the devices detonated shortly after being handled by the victims. <strong>This could suggest a sophisticated trigger mechanism, rather than a simple timer, or manual detonator.</strong></p>

                       <ul>
                           <li><em>On March 18th, 2018 - two Caucasian males were wounded in a blast while biking or walking their bikes in the East Oak Hill area of West Austin. 
                                   Authorities believe that the device in this instance may have been activated by a trip wire, showing an increased level of sophistication in the perpetrators rigging abilities. </em></li>

                           <li><em>On March 20th,2018 - The fifth bombing took place in the early hours at a FedEx distribution center in Schertz, Texas, northeast of San Antonio. 
                                   The explosion left a female employee with a non-life-threatening percussion injury from the blast. The device detonated as it was being moved from an elevated conveyor belt to a lower section. 
                                   The device contained shrapnel consisting of nails and pieces of metal. Reports on the ground have said that the package was destined for Austin. </em></li>
                       </ul>

                    <p>The suspect was identified as 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas. Who upon being pursued by law enforcement drove his vehicle into a ditch before manually detonating another device. 
                       Conditt had previous engineering and precision manufacturing experience.</p>   

                <h2>The Bishop</h2>

                    <p>In 2007, an individual known as "The Bishop" <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/iowa-man-sentenced-37-years-prison-mailing-pipe-bombs-and-threats-investment-firms-bid">mailed pipe bombs to various Chicago financial institutions</a>
                       after demanding they raise stock prices to $6.66.The packages were not rigged to explode but were intended as warnings as they had lacked detonating devices. The suspect, <strong>John Patrick Tompkins</strong>, 
                       a machinist from Dubuque, Iowa was arrested and sentenced to 37 years in prison.</p>
