    <h1>Parcel Bombers</h1>
     <p>In the past few hours, US Secret Service and law enforcement intercepted a series of explosive devices intended for delivery to a number of high profile political targets. 
         On Monday, an explosive device was found in the mailbox of George Soros's home in Katonah, NY. 
         Since then, packages potentially containing explosives have been addressed or delivered to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 
         former President Barack Obama, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Rep. Maxine Waters, and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz. 
         Another device, addressed to Former CIA Director John Brennan, was sent to CNN in New York. </p>
